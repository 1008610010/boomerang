<h1>Boomerang Howto #6:<br>Configuring boomerang</h1>
<p>
To use boomerang, you first include <code>boomerang.js</code> in your html file and
then call the <code>BOOMR.init()</code> method.  This should be sufficient to measure
page performance, but may not be useful enough to you as a site owner.  You still won't
get data back to your server, and probably won't be able to measure the user's bandwidth
either.
</p>
<p>
In this document we'll look at all the different parameters you can use to configure
boomerang and its built in plugins.  If you have additional plugins, consult their
documentation for details on how to configure them.
</p>

<h2>Configuring boomerang</h2>
<p>
To configure boomerang and its plugins, you pass in a configuration object to the <code>init()</code>
method:
</p>
<pre>
BOOMR.init({
		key: value,
		...
	});
</pre>
<p>
boomerang has the following configurable parameters:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>beacon_url</dt>
<dd>
The URL to beacon results back to.  All parameters will be added to this URL's
query string.  This URL should not already have a query string component.<br>
There is no default value for this parameter.  If not set, no beacon will be sent.
</dd>

<dt>site_domain</dt>
<dd>
The domain that all cookies should be set on.  Boomerang will try to auto-detect this,
but unless your site is of the <code>foo.com</code> format, it will probably get it
wrong.  It's a good idea to set this to whatever part of your domain you'd like to
share bandwidth and performance measurements across.<br>
If you have multiple domains, then you're out of luck.  You'll just have to get 
separate measurements across them.
</dd>

<dt>user_ip</dt>
<dd>
Despite its name, this is really a free-form string used to uniquely identify the user's
current internet connection.  It's used primarily by the bandwidth test to determine
whether it should re-measure the user's bandwidth or just use the value stored in the
cookie.  You may use IPv4, IPv6 or anything else that you think can be used to identify
the user's network connection.
</dd>

<dt>log</dt>
<dd>
By default, boomerang will attempt to use the logger component from YUI if it finds it
or firebug if it finds that instead.  If it finds neither, it will default to not
logging anything.  You can define your own logger by setting the <code>log</code>
parameter to a function that logs messages.<br>
The signature of this function is:
<pre>
function log(oMessage, sLevel, sSource);
</pre>
Where<dl>
<dt>oMessage</dt> <dd>is the object/message to be logged.  It is up to you to decide how to log objects.<dd>
<dt>sLevel</dt> <dd>is the log level, with values of "error", "warn", "info" and "debug"</dd>
<dt>sSource</dt> <dd>is the source of the log message.  This will typically be the string "boomerang" followed by the name of a plugin</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dt>autorun</dt>
<dd>
By default, boomerang runs automatically and attaches its <code>page_ready</code> handler to
the <code>window.onload</code> event.  If you set <code>autorun</code> to <code>false</code>,
this will not happen and you will need to call <code>BOOMR.page_ready()</code> yourself.
</dd>

<dt>&lt;plugin_name&gt;<dt>
<dd>
Each plugin is configured through a sub-object of the config object.  The key is the name
of the plugin.  In the following sections we'll see how to configure our built-in plugins.
</dd>
