These are some of the ways that one can use boomerang.  This will help us make sure the library
actually supports all possible use cases.

1. Measure a page's perceived performance.

We need the ability to measure the time the user thinks it took to load a page.  This is typically
the time between the user clicking a link (or entering a URL into the browser) and the page becoming
usable.

While it's easy enough to note the time when a user clicked a link if the link was on a page you
control, it's not easy to tell the exact moment when a user enters a URL into a browser and hits
enter.  We'll therefore only concentrate on link clicks on pages that we control.

One unknown is the time when a page becomes usable.  For most pages, this is when the onload event
fires, however, there may be pages on which the onload event fires before the page is actually
usable (eg, a lot of content loaded via javascript), or when the page becomes usable before the
onload event fires (eg, hidden resources downloaded via javascript at the bottom of the page).
In both these cases, the developer of the page has a better idea of when their page has become
usable, so they should have the ability to tell the library when to fire this event.
